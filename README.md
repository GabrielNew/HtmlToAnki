# HTML TO APKG CONVERTER

This project's main goal is to help students, professors or anyone who studies with flashcards. You can use your flashcards in a software like ANKI, but to use them you'll need to a specific file in the APKG format. Some websites may do it for you, but unfortunatly the majority of these websites aren't completly free.

### ABOUT THIS SCRIPT 🛠️

This script was build with [Python 3.12.2](https://docs.python.org/3/) and two libraries called [Beautifulsoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [genanki](https://pypi.org/project/genanki/).

### NEXT STEPS
- [x] Develop a simple script to convert HTML in APKG file.
- [ ] Develop feature to work with images.
- [ ] Develop an API to make this public and easier to use.

> [!TIP]
You may use this script and make any changes. There is no need to install these libraries in your local machine, create a VENV to Python, it's very easy.  

> [!WARNING]
This script is just an alpha version, so it has some limitations and may contains bugs. One example is that this script, doesn't work with flashcard and images yet.
